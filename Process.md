# ðŸš€ End-to-End DevOps Automation Setup

This guide walks you through setting up an **automated DevOps pipeline** that integrates **GitHub**, **n8n**, **Zapier**, and **Make.com**. The goal is to automatically create Jira tickets from GitHub commits, notify teams on Slack, and archive logs to a storage solution for easy access and traceability.

## Step 1: Setting Up GitHub Commit Triggers

### 1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
If you donâ€™t have one, create a GitHub repository or use an existing one.

### 1.2 Set up GitHub Webhooks
1. Go to **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add Webhook**.
2. In the **Payload URL**, enter the URL of your **n8n** instance (e.g., `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/github-commit`).
3. Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
4. Under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**, select **Push Events**.
5. Click **Add webhook** to save.

## Step 2: Setting Up n8n Workflow for Jira Ticket Creation

### 2.1 Install n8n
1. Install **n8n** locally or use their cloud version. You can follow installation instructions at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io).

### 2.2 Create a New Workflow in n8n
1. Log in to **n8n** and create a **New Workflow**.

### 2.3 Add GitHub Trigger Node
1. Add the **GitHub Trigger** node.
2. Link your GitHub account with n8n by providing the necessary credentials.
3. Set the trigger to listen for **Push Events**.

### 2.4 Add Jira Ticket Creation Node
1. Add the **Jira Node** to your workflow.
2. Connect it to the **GitHub Trigger** node.
3. Configure Jira credentials and map the fields:
   - **Summary**: `GitHub Commit: {{commit.message}}`
   - **Description**: `Created automatically via commit from GitHub.`
   - **Issue Type**: `Bug` (or `Feature`, depending on the commit type).
   
4. Save and activate the workflow.

## Step 3: Setting Up Slack Notifications Using Zapier

### 3.1 Create a Zap in Zapier
1. Log in to **Zapier** and create a **New Zap**.

### 3.2 Set Trigger for Jira Issue Creation
1. Select **Jira** as the app and choose **New Issue** as the trigger.
2. Connect your **Jira** account to Zapier.
3. Select the Jira project where tickets will be created.

### 3.3 Set Action to Send Slack Notifications
1. Select **Slack** as the action app.
2. Choose **Send Channel Message**.
3. Connect your **Slack** account and select the channel (e.g., `#devops`).
4. Customize the Slack message template. Example:
   - "New Jira Ticket Created: {{Ticket Summary}}"
   - Link to the Jira ticket: `https://jira.example.com/browse/{{Ticket ID}}`

### 3.4 Test and Activate the Zap
1. Test the Zap by creating a ticket manually or through the **n8n** automation.
2. Once successful, turn on the Zap to enable automatic Slack notifications.

## Step 4: Setting Up Log Archiving and Dashboard Updates in Make.com

### 4.1 Create an Account in Make.com
1. Go to **Make.com** and create an account.

### 4.2 Create a New Scenario in Make.com
1. Click **Create a New Scenario** in Make.com.

### 4.3 Add GitHub, Jira, and Slack Modules
1. Connect **GitHub**, **Jira**, and **Slack** accounts to **Make.com**.
2. Set up GitHub to listen for commits, Jira to fetch ticket data, and Slack for additional notifications.

### 4.4 Set Up Log Archiving
1. Add a module for cloud storage (e.g., **Google Drive** or **AWS S3**).
2. When a commit happens, save the logs (e.g., GitHub commit hash, Jira issue ID, timestamps) in cloud storage.

### 4.5 Set Up Dashboard Updates
1. Add modules to update a **Google Sheets** or **Grafana** dashboard.
2. Use **Make.com** to read Jira issues and update the dashboard with:
   - **Issue ID**
   - **Ticket Status**
   - **Priority**
   - **Resolved Date**

### 4.6 Activate the Scenario
After testing, activate the scenario to archive logs and update dashboards automatically.

---

## Step 5: Testing the Full Automation

### 5.1 Make a Commit to GitHub
- Commit a change to the repository.

### 5.2 Monitor the Flow
1. **n8n**: Ensure Jira ticket creation is triggered.
2. **Zapier**: Verify that Slack receives a notification with the ticket details.
3. **Make.com**: Check if logs are archived and the dashboard is updated.

---

## Step 6: Future Proofing and Maintenance

### 6.1 Monitoring
- Regularly check the logs in **n8n**, **Zapier**, and **Make.com** to ensure everything is functioning smoothly.

### 6.2 Scalability
- Modify workflows in **n8n**, **Zapier**, or **Make.com** to add additional steps without disrupting the existing flow (e.g., notify more teams, handle more complex workflows, etc.).
